**Ready-to-Develop Finance Application**

## What Should I Do to Make the Code Work?
First of all, you must open a **Firebase** Account and activate the **"Functions"** feature.

**Enable Firebase Authentication and Firebase Cloud Firestore**

Create a **Stripe** Account.

Activate your Stripe account otherwise you will not receive your "pk_live" key and you will not be able to receive online payments.

After Doing All This, all you have to do is paste your "pk_live" key in the place I specified in main.dart and paste your Firebase Functions link in the place I specified in the makePPayment function in card.dart.
